   This is a template for blueprint debugging. Nodes in a template should be designed to be as modular and self-
   contained as possible, and this blueprint will exploit that fact to allow you to test a node quickly. To use this
   blueprint template:
   1. Deploy a VM on your cloud environment. You can do this directly (via the OpenStack/AWS/whatever dashboard) or by
   deploying a known functioning blueprint that you wish to enhance.
   2. Copy this entire blueprint template to a new directory.
   3. Fix the inputs template to use your inputs (specifying things like ssh keys, users for agents or Fabric ssh
   calls). The most important thing you will need is the IP of the VM you deployed in step #1, which you connect to in
   the "base_vm" node_template below.
   4. Implement your new node in your debugging blueprint. This blueprint will deploy that node and ONLY that node, and
   thus can be deployed much faster than your entire blueprint.
   5. You will almost certainly need a way to revert your VM back to its original state to retest as you find bugs.
   You can do this via a manually-written shell script (which can itself be invoked as a blueprint step if you feel
   like being really meta) or by saving an image of your deployed VM as a snapshot and then re-deploying the VM from your
   cloud provider.
   6. Test until you are satisfied with your new node, and then add it to your original blueprint (along with any new
   inputs or imports) and re-test to ensure you don't get weird cross-talk between nodes.
   This blueprint assumes you are making use of the script plugin or a plugin of your own devising. If you are using
   the Fabric plugin, the blueprint_debugging_template_fabric.yaml blueprint is the one you want.

imports:
  # REQUIRED IMPORTS: Feel free to change version or URL to match your environment, but you must import
  # this for any blueprint to work.
  - http://www.getcloudify.org/spec/cloudify/3.4.2/types.yaml

  # NEW IMPORTS START: Add any new imports between the START and END comments. This will make it easier to see
  # exactly what you need to add to your final blueprint.

  # NEW IMPORTS END

inputs:
  # REQUIRED INPUTS: The minimum information you need is the IP address of the server you wish to test
  # and fabric connection information (fabric user and key path on the Cloudify manager)
  server_ip:
    description: The ip of the VM that you are testing on.
    type: string

  agent_user:
    description: User ID that will own the Fabric process run on the remote VM
    type: string

  agent_key_path:
    description: Private key fabric_user should use to ssh into the remote VM (must be present on Cloudify manager)
    type: string

  # NEW INPUTS START: Add any new inputs your node will need between these START and END comments.

  # NEW INPUTS END


node_templates:

  base_vm:
    # This is the deployed VM which you will be using to test with.
    # Note that the agent_config section will install an agent on the remote VM; we do not assume one is there already.
    type: cloudify.nodes.Compute
    properties:
      ip: { get_input: server_ip }
      agent_config:
        user: { get_input: agent_user }
        key: { get_input: agent_key_path }

    # NEW NODE_TEMPLATES START: Insert any new nodes that you need between these START and END comments.
    # If you find you are adding many nodes to the same testing blueprint, you are probably testing too much at once.
    # Nodes should follow basic single-responsibility principles of object-oriented design: do one
    # thing, do it well, and do it only.

    # NEW NODE_TEMPLATES END

outputs:

  server_ip:
    # Somewhat redundant echo of the server IP input, just to put a placeholder in the outputs section.
    description: VM IP address
    value: { get_property: [ base_vm, ip ] }

    # NEW OUTPUTS START: Add any new outputs your deployment should create between these START and END comments

    # NEW OUTPUTS END
